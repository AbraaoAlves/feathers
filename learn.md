On this page you will find additional resources and guides about Feathers. Make sure to first get familiar with the basics in the [Quick Start guide](/quick-start/).

## API docs

For the API documentation with detailed information about the Feathers specific API, configuration and to see the Changelog and License head over to the [Docs](/docs/) page.

## Frameworks

Feathers works great with any frontend that can connect through the REST API or websockets. Sometimes it is just a few lines of code to make a frontend turn real-time. Which is why implemented some TodoMVC examples and guides that all connect to the same Feathers real-time API.

Pick your poison:

- jQuery
- React
- Angular
- CanJS
- iOS
- Android

We don't know all the frameworks out there so if you don't see your favourite, submit an issue or - even better - a pull request and we'll try our best to help out.

## Databases

Feathers already has plugins for CRUD operations on many different databases:

- In memory - A service that stores everything locally in memory. Probably not ideal in production environments but great for prototyping.
- MongoDB - A basic MongoDB implementation. Easy to use.
- Mongoose - Support for the MongoDB ODM which already gives you schemas and validation out of the box.
- NeDB - A file based database similar to MongoDB, great if you don't want or need a full blown database.
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

If you are wondering how to customize those existing adapters and make it easier to switch between different databases, read more about hooks in the next paragraph.
