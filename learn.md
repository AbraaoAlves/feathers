## What's next?

This guide hopefully gave you an overview of how Feathers works. We created a Todo service and made it available through a REST API and SocketIO. Then we moved to using MongoDB as the backend storage and learned how to process and validate our data. After that we added PassportJS authentication for both, the REST API and websockets and then briefly discussed how you might authorize that authenticated user and make sure that websocket events only get dispatched to where we want them to.

The next step is definitely reading through the [API documentation](/api/) for a more detailed information on how to configure and use certain parts of Feathers. The [FAQ](/faq/) also has some answers to questions that come up regularly. For a growing list of official plugins, have a look at the [Feathersjs GitHub organization](https://github.com/feathersjs).

If you have any other questions, feel free to submit them as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues) or on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the `feathers` or `feathersjs` tag or join [#feathersjs](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=feathersjs) on Freenode IRC.
