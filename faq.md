On this page you can find a list of Feathers related questions that came up before. Make sure to also head over to the [Express FAQ](http://expressjs.com/faq.html). As already mentioned, since Feathers directly extends Express, everything applies here as well. You are more than welcome to submit any questions as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues) or on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the `feathers` or `feathersjs` tag.

## Do I get websocket events from REST calls?

## Is there a way to know where a method call came from?

Sometimes you want to allow certain service calls internally (like creating a new user) but not through the REST or Websocket API.

## How do I add authorization?

## Can I only send certain events?

## How can I filter my data?

## Can I add custom middleware to a service?

## How do I configure multiple servers?

## What about Koa?
