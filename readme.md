Feathers is a light weight web application framework that rides on top of [Express](http://expressjs.com). It makes it easy to create RESTful web services and real-time applications using [socket.io](http://socket.io).

The core focus of Feathers is **your data**. We believe that ultimately your app's purpose is to manage data in some fashion and so that's all you should really need to deal with. Managing your data.
